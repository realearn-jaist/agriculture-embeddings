This directory contains code and data used for experiment on TreatO dataset.

Simply running the script 'reasonE.test.py' should use trained model as stored in directory 'model/' and generate accuracy numbers as reported in the paper.

Script 'reasonE.train.py' is for fresh training. Script 'reasonE.retrain.py' is to retrain the latest trained model starting from the point where last training ended.
